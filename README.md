# Math_Symbols_Classify

In this work, we focused on the classification of such images of numerous handwritten mathematical symbols. For this classification, we have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and worked with three different datasets to test our modelâ€™s efficiency. Our CNN model of 11 layers (6 were convolutional layers) worked to classify 16 classes (each denoting a mathematical symbol or digit) and had an accuracy of 98.71%, 99.01%, and 99.85% respectively on three publicly available datasets.

Dataset I: https://www.kaggle.com/sagyamthapa/handwritten-math-symbols
Dataset II: https://www.kaggle.com/clarencezhao/handwritten-math-symbol-dataset
Dataset III: https://www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols

The result: 
Dataset	Training Accuracy	Validation Accuracy	Test Accuracy
Dataset I	99.60%	98.81%	98.71%
Dataset II	99.13%	99.41%	99.01%
Dataset III	99.71%	99.91%	99.85%

Further, we also analyzed the performance of the model based on F1-accuracy. The three respective F1 accuracies of the three datasets are 0.99, 0.99, 1.00 and the average F1 accuracy we achieved was 0.99.
